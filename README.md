# Robin-Round-Judge
Project Title: Design and Implementation of a Round-Robin Arbiter using Verilog on EDA Playground
Project Description:

This project focuses on designing and implementing a round-robin arbiter, a fundamental component in digital systems used to manage access to shared resources in a fair and efficient manner. The arbiter will be coded in Verilog, a hardware description language, and tested using EDA Playground for simulation and verification.

Objectives:

Round-Robin Algorithm Design: Develop the logic for a round-robin arbitration scheme, ensuring that each requestor gets equal opportunity to access the shared resource in a cyclic order.
Verilog Implementation: Implement the round-robin arbiter in Verilog, including modules for request handling, priority management, and grant generation.
Simulation and Verification: Utilize EDA Playground to simulate the Verilog code and verify the correct operation of the round-robin arbiter. This will involve testing various request patterns to ensure fair arbitration and proper functionality.
Key Features:

Fair Arbitration: Ensure equal access to the shared resource by cycling through requestors in a round-robin manner.
Priority Management: Dynamic adjustment of priority to ensure that the next requestor in line is granted access.
Scalability: Design the arbiter to handle a configurable number of requestors.
Tools and Technologies:

Design Tools: EDA Playground for simulation and verification.
Hardware Description Language: Verilog.
Arbiter Logic: Round-robin algorithm for fair resource allocation.
Expected Outcome:
By the end of this project, a fully functional Verilog model of a round-robin arbiter will be implemented and verified through simulation, demonstrating proficiency in digital design, arbitration mechanisms, and hardware description languages.
